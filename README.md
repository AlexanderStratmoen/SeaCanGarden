# The Code
This repository follows a pretty standard layout. The first folder labeled old code contains unused or unreferenced code. You will not find an explanation of that code here and much of it is unusable.   The sole purpose of this folder is to look at past versions of the project.  The project was done in iterations so the codes are labeled based on their version.  Old versions go in the old code folder.  

The next folder labeled "reference" contains code that is not used for any of the actual Sea Can function but was test code (different experiments I did) that was referenced on my blog.  There is also a folder labeled "demo code" this contains all of the demo code that was used for inspiration in the project. None of this code belongs to me, it is simply code I have gathered from the World Wide Webs and most of the files have the original author credited at the beginning of the code.
